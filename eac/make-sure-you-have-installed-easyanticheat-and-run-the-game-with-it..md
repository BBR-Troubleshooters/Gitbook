1. Run the [EAC Fix batch](https://github.com/livingflore/BattleBitEACFix) (download button).
2. Ensure that **BOTH** VCRedists installed properly - [x86](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc\_redist.x86.exe) and [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc\_redist.x64.exe). When running installers you should see 3 buttons - repair, uninstall and cancel as on screenshot below. If you can't see it - proceed with installation.

4. You might experience some issues with connection and therefore EAC can't reach its servers. Try using [Cloudflare WARP](https://1.1.1.1) or any private VPN on this matter.\
