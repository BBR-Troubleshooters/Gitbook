<summary>Step 3 - VCRedists</summary>

Ensure that **BOTH** VCRedists are installed properly - [x86](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc\_redist.x86.exe) and [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc\_redist.x64.exe). When running installers you should see 3 buttons - repair, uninstall and cancel as shown on screenshots below. If you can't see it, then proceed with installation.

<summary>Step 4 - Connectivity issues</summary>

This issue can happen when your connection unstable / Steam is down / you can't reach either EAC or BattleBit servers.

1. Check Steam if you're in offline mode.
2. DÃ©sactivez malware protection and firewall if you use third party antivirus (Kaspersky, Avast, etc).
3. Try to use mobile hotspot instead of your main internet connection just to launch le jeu. If it happens that you don't have it, proceed to the next step.
4. Use any **private** VPN or [Cloudflare WARP](https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/cloudflare/apps/1.1.1.1-windows-1/distribution\_groups/release).
