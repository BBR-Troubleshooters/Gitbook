# ðŸ”˜ You were kicked by anti cheat.

1. if you using custom lang file - get rid of it and you're good to go.
2. Make sure that you don't have EAC entries in hosts file (`etc/hosts` or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`) which was needed for some games (Star Citizen as example).
3. Run the [EAC Fix batch](https://github.com/livingflore/BattleBitEACFix/releases) (.bat file).
4. Ensure that absolutely **NOTHING** blocks EAC connection (antivirus/firewall/ISP).
5. Delete `Certificates` folder in Installed Files/`EasyAntiCheat` folder and verify game files.
