# Your account is being reviewed by moderators.

**First of all - be patient, this can take up to a few hours.**

This is not a ban but a timeout and it may be lifted after a game moderator has reviewed your gameplay. There are multiple factors of why the system has timed you out, as well as abnormal amount of reports for specified reason.\
\
**This can happen again** even after your timeout gets lifted. We understand that this system isn't perfect and developers looking into improving it.
