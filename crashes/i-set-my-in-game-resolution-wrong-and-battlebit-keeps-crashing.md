# ðŸ”˜ I set my in-game resolution wrong and battlebit keeps crashing

Step 1: Press the windows key + R on your keyboard and type in the "Open" dialog: `%appdata%`

It should look like this:

Step 2: In the opened file explorer, search and open a file called "BttleBitConfig.ini":

Step 3: Find the resolution line and adjust it back to your monitor settings:

Step 4: Press save, close the file, and restart the game
