# ðŸ”˜ I set my in-game resolution wrong and battlebit keeps crashing

Step 1: Press the windows key + R on your keyboard to open the run dialog box. Type `%appdata%` into the box and press "OK".

It should look like this:

Step 2: In the opened file explorer, search and open a file called "BattleBitConfig.ini":

Step 3: Find the resolution line and adjust it back to your monitor settings:

Step 4: Press save, close the file, and restart the game
